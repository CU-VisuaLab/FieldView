# FieldView
Data Collection Frontend App

In the new version, I've added two new columns to the data collection screen and inserted them into the sqlite. 
But looks like they are not stored into the DB correctly. 

The android chart library I am using is MPAndroidChart https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart

The datasets I found online were from data.gov and they were in the folder.
